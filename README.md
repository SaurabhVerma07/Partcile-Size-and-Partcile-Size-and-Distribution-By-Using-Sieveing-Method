# Partcile-Size-and-Partcile-Size-and-Distribution-By-Using-Sieveing-Method
The sieving method is a widely used technique to determine the particle size and particle size distribution of granular materials. This method involves the mechanical separation of particles based on their size using a series of sieves with progressively smaller mesh openings.
A stack of standard test sieves is arranged from the largest opening at the top to the smallest at the bottom. The sample material is placed on the top sieve and subjected to shaking or vibrating, allowing particles to pass through the sieves according to their sizes.

Each sieve retains particles that are larger than its mesh size, and the amount of material collected on each sieve gives a direct measure of the distribution of particle sizes in the sample. The mass retained on each sieve is weighed, and the cumulative distribution is calculated.

This method is simple, cost-effective, and suitable for a wide range of materials such as sand, gravel, pharmaceuticals, and powdered chemicals.
Key Points:
Objective: To determine the size range and percentage distribution of particles in a bulk material.

Equipment Used: Sieve shaker, a stack of standard test sieves, weighing balance, and dry granular sample.

Principle: Particles are separated by mechanical means using sieves of different mesh sizes.

Applications: Construction materials testing, pharmaceutical formulations, food processing, ceramics, and mining.
